    "## Creating Docker Container Images\n",
    "Docker containers are instances of Docker images. We have been using the [continuumio/anaconda3](https://hub.docker.com/r/continuumio/anaconda3) Docker image and a container based on this image as our Python development environment in this class. We are now going to learn how to make our own Docker images, and then deploy a container based on this image to the web. Let's get started!\n",
    "\n",
    "Build specifications for an image are listed in a special file called `Dockerfile`. From the [Docker Docs](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/):\n",
    ">Docker can build images automatically by reading the instructions from a Dockerfile. A Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image. Using docker build users can create an automated build that executes several command-line instructions in succession.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example `Dockerfile` for building a Flask image:\n",
    "\n",
    "```docker\n",
    "FROM continuumio/anaconda3:2020.11\n",
    "\n",
    "ADD . /code\n",
    "WORKDIR /code\n",
    "ENTRYPOINT [\"python\", \"app.py\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is what each part of this `Dockerfile` specifies about the to-be-built image:\n",
    "* `FROM <image>[:<tag>]`: A Dockerfile must begin with a FROM instruction. The FROM instruction specifies the Parent Image from which you are building.\n",
    "    * For our Flask app, our base image will be the same [continuumio/anaconda3](https://hub.docker.com/r/continuumio/anaconda3) Docker image we have been using in this class.\n",
    "* `ADD <src> <dest>`: The ADD instruction copies new files, directories or remote file URLs from `<src>` and adds them to the filesystem of the image at the path `<dest>`.\n",
    "    * For our Flask app, we will copy the contents of the current working directory (which should be our project directory which has our `app.py` in it) into a new `/code` directory of the container when a container is instantiated.\n",
    "* `WORKDIR /path/to/workdir`: The WORKDIR instruction sets the working directory for any RUN, CMD, ENTRYPOINT, COPY and ADD instructions that follow it in the Dockerfile. If the WORKDIR doesn’t exist, it will be created even if it’s not used in any subsequent Dockerfile instruction.\n",
    "    * For our Flask app, we want our current working directory of a container to be `/home` so our next command (`ENTRYPOINT`) can use a simple relative path to refer to `app.py`.\n",
    "* `ENTRYPOINT [\"executable\", \"param1\", \"param2\"]`: An ENTRYPOINT allows you to configure a container that will run as an executable. Note: You can use the exec form of ENTRYPOINT to set fairly stable default commands and arguments and then use either form of CMD to set additional defaults that are more likely to be changed.\n",
    "    * For our Flask app, our container is an executable that runs the Flask app. We will invoke the Flask app the same we did directly when we were debugging it.\n",
    "    \n",
    "To create the image, cd into the project directory with the `Dockerfile` (typically this is in your project's top-level directory) and run `docker build -t interview:latest .` On success, your output should look like this:\n",
    "\n",

    "## Deploying a Docker Container Image to Heroku\n",
    "[Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) is a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud. We will use Heroku to host our Flask app on the web so anyone can use it! Here are some pre-Heroku steps to perform to prepare to do this:\n",
    "1. Make sure your Flask `run()` command has the following arguments (read more about this [here](https://medium.com/@ksashok/containerise-your-python-flask-using-docker-and-deploy-it-onto-heroku-a0b48d025e43)):\n",
    "```python\n",
    "port = int(os.environ.get(\"PORT\", 5000))\n",
    "app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=port, debug=False)\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. Create a Heroku account\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main approaches to deploying a Flask app to Heroku:\n",
    "1. [Deploy your app as a Python app](https://devcenter.heroku.com/categories/python-support). To do this, define a [`Procfile`](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/procfile) and a `requirements.txt` for your Python dependencies (this will cause the [Python buildpack](https://elements.heroku.com/buildpacks/heroku/heroku-buildpack-python) to automatically be detected and used by Heroku). Enable [Github Integration](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/github-integration) for your Heroku app, this connects your Heroku app to your app's Github repository. \n",
    "1. [Deploy your app as a Docker container](https://devcenter.heroku.com/categories/deploying-with-docker). Heroku's [\"Deploying with Docker\" documentation](https://devcenter.heroku.com/categories/deploying-with-docker) provides two ways for you to deploy your app with Docker. There are also (at least) one other way to deploy a Flask app with Docker I'll mention here:\n",
    "    1. (Heroku CLI w/pre-build Docker images) Container Registry allows you to deploy pre-built Docker images to Heroku\n",
    "        * Instructions: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/container-registry-and-runtime)\n",
    "        * This approach requires you to install the Heroku CLI on your host machine\n",
    "    1. (Heroku CLI w/Heroku building the Docker images) Build your Docker images with heroku.yml for deployment to Heroku\n",
    "        * Instructions: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/build-docker-images-heroku-yml\n",
    "        * This approach does not require you to install the Heroku CLI on your host machine. Instead, if you wish, you can install the Heroku CLI in our anaconda3_cpsc322 container.\n",
    "    1. (Unofficial w/Github Action bulding the Docker images) Use a Github Action, such as [Heroku Deploy](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/deploy-to-heroku)\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we are learning Docker, here are steps for the [Deploy your app as a Docker container](https://devcenter.heroku.com/categories/deploying-with-docker) approaches A, B, and C. First, there are some shared initial steps for Docker approaches A and B:\n",
    "1. Install the Heroku CLI. \n",
    "    1. For approach A, install it on your host machine. \n",
    "        * On Mac: `brew tap heroku/brew && brew install heroku`\n",
    "        * On Windows: Download the appropriate Windows installer [here](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli)\n",
    "    1. For approach B, install it in the anaconda3_cpsc322 Docker container:\n",
    "        1. Install `gnupg`: `apt install gnupg`\n",
    "        1. Install the Heroku CLI: `curl https://cli-assets.heroku.com/install-ubuntu.sh | sh`\n",
    "1. Login to Heroku via the CLI: `heroku login -i` (then enter your Heroku email and password)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach A: Deploy Pre-built Docker Images\n",
    "1. Go to https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps and create a new Heroku app, then choose \"Container Registry Use Heroku CLI\"\n",
    "1. Back at the command line, log in to Container Registry: `heroku container:login`\n",
    "1. Then build and image and push it to Heroku's Container Registry: `heroku container:push web`\n",
    "1. Release the newly pushed images to deploy your app: `heroku container:release web`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach B: Build your Docker Images on Heroku\n",
    "1. If you have not already done so, make your top-level project directory into a local git repository (e.g. `git init`, `git add -A`, `git commit -m \"initial\"`)\n",
    "1. In your project's top-level directory, create a Heroku app from your project: `heroku create <app name>`\n",
    "    1. This should add a new remote to your local Git repo for Heroku (confirm with `git remote -v`)\n",
    "1. Create a `heroku.yml` file with the following contents:\n",
    "```yml\n",
    "build:\n",
    "  docker:\n",
    "    web: Dockerfile\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. This specifies how to build the docker image. Commit this file to your local repo.\n",
    "1. Set the stack of your app to container: `heroku stack:set container`\n",
    "1. Push your app to Heroku: `git push heroku master`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach C: Set up Github Actions to Deploy Docker Images to Heroku\n",
    "For this approach, we will set up our Github repo so that when we push to it, a Github Action automatically builds our Docker image and then pushes the image to Heroku for deployment. Following the instructions for the [Deploy to Heroku](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/deploy-to-heroku) Github Action:\n",
    "1. Via the Heroku web interface, create a new app.\n",
    "1. In your local Git repo, create a directory called `.github` and in that directory create a directory called `workflows`. In `.github/workflows`, create a file called `main.yml`. Put the following in this `main.yml` file:\n",
    "```yml\n",
    "name: Deploy\n",
    "on:\n",
    "  push:\n",
    "    branches:\n",
    "      - master\n",
    "jobs:\n",
    "  deploy:\n",
    "    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n",

    "      - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n",
    "      - uses: akhileshns/heroku-deploy@v3.12.12 # This is the action\n",
    "        with:\n",
    "          heroku_api_key: ${{secrets.HEROKU_API_KEY}}\n",
    "          heroku_app_name: \"YOUR APP's NAME\" #Must be unique in Heroku\n",
    "          heroku_email: \"YOUR EMAIL\"\n",
    "          usedocker: true\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. Replace the `heroku_app_name` and `heroku_email` with values for your app name and for your Heroku account email.\n",
    "1. Go to your Heroku Account Settings page. Scroll to the bottom until you see API Key. Copy this key to your clipboard.\n",
    "1. In your Github Repo, go to Settings -> Secrets and click on \"New Secret\". Then enter HEROKU_API_KEY as the name and paste the copied API Key as the value.\n",
    "1. You can now push your project to GitHub and it will be automatically deployed to Heroku henceforth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: with this approach, you can add a \"build\" job that runs your unit tests on push as part of test-driven development. You can specify that your push should only be deployed to Heroku when the \"build\" job succeeds by adding the following line to the \"deploy\" job: `needs: build`.
